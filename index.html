<! --- Imagery of the Past --->

<div class = "box-with-shadow2">
</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Imagery-of-Past-Projects">Imagery of Past Projects</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository contains a snapshot of some of my more interesting projects from the 1970's to late 1980's which I can say that I had actually built myself. I do have other interesting hardware projects but some of them were not built by me originally. This will provide you with a bit more visual context as to what type and extent of projects I used to build before getting distracted with a professional career in similar activities.

<! --- MultiFlex Terminal  --->

<b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/MultiFlex-Z80-H19-Terminal-Emulation-ROMs">New H19/VT52 firmware support for the Multiflex Video Display Terminal Kit of the 1982 era (3 ROM images)</a></b>

This repository contains new firmware for the Multiflex Z80 Video Display Terminal Kit (previously sold by Exceltronix of Toronto Canada in 1984) which adds a plethora
of new features and functionality, including new H19/VT52 terminal emulation support. The original stock firmware which came with the terminal was quite primitive at best, only providing very 
basic text sending and receiving functionality.

<! --- Colossus Control Computer --->

<div class = "box-with-shadow2">
</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Colossus_Control_Computer">The 'Colossus Control Computer' -- A Beast of a Z80 Machine!</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository documents my "Colossus Control Computer" which was my main go-to development machine ("It has every feature including the kitchen sink") which was started in March 1985. I call it a "beast of a Z80 machine" because it has more odds and ends + add-on gadgets than with most self-built computers. It was also the testbed and development platform for my follow-on March 1987 "Phoenix MIDI Computer". An interesting sub-project for Colossus was my Dec 1985 'Drum Pad Triggers for a MIDI Drum Machine'.

<! --- MIDI Drum Pad Triggers --->

<div class = "box-with-shadow2">
</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/MIDI_Drum_Pad_Triggers">'Drum Pad Triggering System' for MIDI Usage - 1985</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository documents a sub-project I designed and built in December 1985 to simulate SIMMONS electronic drum pads, "on the cheap" ($20 in parts compared to $1500). The intent was to design a physical drum pad interface which would provide digital triggers to my then-new Colossus Computer Computer which itself would create MIDI messages for a Roland TR-707 drum machine.

<blockquote>
This repository explains how to boot from CP/M-3 via the HxC Floppy Emulator attached to the floppy disk controller interface connector of the 1985-era Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC. This will allow the Cypher SBC to boot from the floppy emulator rather than its stock 8" floppy disks or 22MB hard disk.

<blockquote>
This repository documents two designs for a programmable RAM cartridge for the Roland JX8P synthesizer which I had designed and built in late 1985. Prior to this 
design my only option would have been to buy an expensive Roland MC-16C Memory Cartridge which held just 16 patches. With my new design, the single plug-in cartridge 
could handle 256 patches and be programmed by an external computer.
