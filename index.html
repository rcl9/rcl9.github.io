<p>This is the main landing page for <i>Rob's1970's and 1980's Retro-Computing Archive</i> site on <a href="https://github.com/rcl9">GitHub</a> and its various repositories:

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Imagery-of-Past-Projects">Imagery of Past Projects</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository contains a snapshot of some of my more interesting projects from the 1970's to late 1980's which I can say that I had actually built myself. I do have other interesting hardware projects but some of them were not built by me originally. This will provide you with a bit more visual context as to what type and extent of projects I used to build before getting distracted with a professional career in similar activities.

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/MultiFlex-Z80-H19-Terminal-Emulation-ROMs">New H19/VT52 firmware support for the Multiflex Video Display Terminal Kit of the 1982 era (3 ROM images)</a></b>

<blockquote>
Between June 1984 and February 1988 the author wrote this new Heath H19/VT52 (and basic ADM3A) emulation support for the stock Multiflex Z80 Video Display Terminal Kit sold by Exceltronix of Toronto Canada. The original stock firmware which came with the terminal was quite primitive at best, only providing very basic text sending and receiving functionality. It was a nice piece of hardware but with lackluster software support.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer-1984-by-Motel-Computers---History-and-Documentation">Cypher Z80/68000 Single Board Computer (of the 1984 era)</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository strives to provide a historical snapshot, archive and description of the short lived Cypher Z80/68000 single board computer which was designed, built and sold by Motel Computers of Willowdale Ontario.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer----Expansion-Board">Parallel I/O, SASI Controller and R-Bus Interfaces Expansion Board for the Cypher Z80/68k SBC</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository documents the hardware expansion board that I had designed and built for the Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC in 1986.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer----Port-Organizer-Add-On">Port Organizer and Break-Out Box Add-On for the Cypher Z80/68000 SBC (1985-era)</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository documents the rather simple port organizer and break-out box that I had designed and built for the Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC in 1985.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer---Running-CPM-3-via-the-HxC-Floppy-Emulator">How to Boot CP/M-3 from the HxC Floppy Emulator on the Cypher Z80/68000 SBC</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository explains how to boot from CP/M-3 via the HxC Floppy Emulator attached to the floppy disk controller interface connector of the 1985-era Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC. This will allow the Cypher SBC to boot from the floppy emulator rather than its stock 8" floppy disks or 22MB hard disk.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Roland-JX8P-Synthesizer-Memory-Cartridges">Memory Cartridges for the Roland JX8P Synthesizer (from 1985)</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository documents two designs for a programmable RAM cartridge for the Roland JX8P synthesizer which I had designed and built in late 1985. Prior to this design my only option would have been to buy an expensive Roland MC-16C Memory Cartridge which held just 16 patches. With my new design, the single plug-in cartridge could handle 256 patches and be programmed by an external computer.
</blockquote>

</p><b> <a href="https://github.com/rcl9/Roland-JX8P-Synthesizer-Patch-Collection">Roland JX8P Synthesizer Patch Collection</a></b>

<blockquote>
This repository contains 15 Roland JX8P synthesizer patch banks, with up to 16 voices per bank, which were collected or created by me between 1985 and 1989.
